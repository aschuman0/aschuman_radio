# Shadow Journal Radio
Shadow Journal Radio is an internet radio site which currently broadcasts one show a week hosted by Aaron. The site consists of pages created from a series of JSON files stored in the app. The application communicates with the Shoutcast server and changes the home page when there is an active broadcast.
The backing broadcast server for Shadow Journal and Lake Bottom Radio is a Shoutcast server hosted on a Google Compute Engine instance.
